                <div class="about">
                    <div><p class="playfair-display">I was born in 1991. I grew up playing outside, with Barbies, Hot Wheels and GI Joes. However, what I preferred was video games. I first tried the NES with my parents when I was 3-4 years old, and I haven't moved away from video games since. In high school, I would bring my Nintendo DS in class to play, and even sometimes skipped school to play World of Warcraft. I was one of those kids who learned quickly and had good grades easily.</p></div>
                    <div><p class="playfair-display">After high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I considered being a surgeon, lawyer, police officer, but in the end, I decided not to go to college and I began my professional journey at 18 when I was hired as a waitress in a retirement home, which led me to be a receptionist part time there too.</p></div>
                    <div><p class="playfair-display">I since then had the chance to learn new skills and abilities in the different positions I occupied and was successful as I am a fast learner. I am also purchasing online courses on Udemy from time to time either to perfect my knowledge or learn completely new skills. This is how I decided to become a web developer.</p></div>
                    <div><p class="playfair-display">In my spare time, as you may have guessed, I play video games. In addition to video games, I like to cook, try new restaurants, hike, craft various things, do sports once in a while and travel. I consider myself lucky that my amazing boyfriend lets me drag him into all my adventures and shares the same hobbies as me. He is also a full time web developer and we have several projects we intend to code together.</p></div>
