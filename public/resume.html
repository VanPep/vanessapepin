                            From December 2022 to April 2023, I was part of the One Off Coverage team. My duties included finding external providers to assist with work orders when our internal providers were unavailable or couldn't meet SLA. I helped make the process more organized and efficient and put together metrics calculators for the team using Excel. As of April 2023, I am now in the team onboarding new providers. I establish contact with interested providers, negotiate terms/rates, get
                            them on contract and work with them throughout the onboarding process. I develop new processes and help improve the current ones. I assist the Service Provider Management team with various administrative tasks. I also assist our manager in leading our international team.

                            Most of my time was spent designing new features or improvements for our home automation control platforms, which was later coded by our web programmers. I was also acting as the project manager for the Web projects team. I tested new product software prior to release to ensure no bugs were introduced and that all the features worked as intended. I assisted the technical support team with more complex issues and acted as their backup when some members of the team were
                            on vacation and/or sick as well as followed up with the engineering director bimonthly on issues that were ongoing. I assisted the shipping and production departments when needed.

                        <p class="border">
                            I was in charge of a team of 9. My main duties were to answer questions from the team and approve certain exceptions to the normal workflow, provide the team and my managers with productivity and statistics reports, provide coaching to our current team members on how to improve their metrics, review metrics weekly with them and train new employees. I was also in charge of developing new processes and improving our current ones when additional tasks/tickets were added
                            to our team's duties. I was regularly assisting the GAP department to process claims, as well as the accounts payable department to help pay invoices.

                        <p class="border">
                            My day consisted of answering customer phone calls, as well as customer service agents' questions. I was also processing GAP claims, working with lenders and/or customers to obtain documents and information to be able to process the said claims, assisting my teammates with questions regarding our processes, developing new processes or improving the current ones and training new employees. When our inboxes were low, I was also assisting the support department to
                            process tickets and accounts payable paying invoices. I was promoted to Senior representative of the Support department in November of 2020.

                        <p class="border">
                            I was operating the front desk: answering calls, scheduling patients, calling patients on received referrals to schedule them and following up, managing the schedule, taking patient payments, verifying insurance benefits, obtaining authorization when necessary and more. I was following up with different doctors' and specialists' offices on patient care and to obtain referrals when asked by patients. I was also assisting the office manager and our claims resolution
                            specialist in their daily tasks and replacing them when they were on vacation or sick. I also sometimes created some marketing material for our sales representative. I did help create new processes to reduce our paper consumption and go towards digital options instead for the areas that permitted it.

                            My main duties were to answer customer calls and emails to assist them with the issues encountered with their home automation products, as well as guide them through the buying process and products to choose from. I was also communicating with the engineering department to get assistance when needed. I would also flag recurring issues for the engineering department to find solutions. I was producing various reports for the commercial manager, including sales,
                            technical support and statistics reports. I was receiving, processing and billing orders (including EDI). I was also in charge of shipping and monthly inventory, as well as taking care of some administrative tasks (filing, writing letters, deposits, etc.). I also helped the production department every now and then.

                        <p>
                            My everyday tasks included assisting the general manager with writing letters, producing various reports and sometimes accompanying her to marketing/PR events. I also took care of some financial tasks including managing the petty cash, residents' billing, deposits and following up with residents whose rent was late. I would also help organize different events and activities. I handled the part of human resources duties that were not handled by head office, including
                            opening new employee files and making sure we had all required documents, communicating any status changes to head office, compile employee hours through Kronos (and paper time sheets before that), assisting the general manager in calculating yearly raises and more. I was in charge of the reception of the residence and its 3 receptionists; managing their work load, schedules and occasionally cover for them. I was also our residence's family physician's secretary; I
                            was scheduling patients, maintaining their files up to date and compliant with government requirements, filing different documents, following up with specialists, scheduling tests, ordering supplies and more. I would sometimes substitute for our rental agents when they were on vacation or sick, including tours of the residence, preparing leases, having future residents sign their lease and collecting deposits.
